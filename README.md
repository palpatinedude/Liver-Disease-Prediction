# Liver-Disease-Prediction
This project, titled "Liver Disease Classifier," is a data-driven application designed to assess and predict the health status of individuals based on data from the "Indian Liver Patient Dataset." It employs various machine learning classifiers, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to analyze patient data and make predictions regarding their liver health. The system offers insights into important health metrics, such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity. It utilizes statistical analysis techniques, such as t-tests, to identify the most significant attributes for diagnosis.
